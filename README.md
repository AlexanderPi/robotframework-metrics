#### How it Works:

1. Read output.xml file using robotframework API
2. Get Suite, Test Case , Keyword , Status and Elapsed time values
3. Convert data to html report using Beautifulsoup

---

#### How to use in project:

1. Install robotmetrics 

    > Case 1: Using pip
    ```
    pip install robotframework-metrics
    ```
    > Case 2: Using setup.py (clone project and run command within root)
    ```
    python setup.py install
    ```

2. Execute robotmetrics command to generate report

    > Case 1: No change in output.xml, log.html file name's and user is in same folder
    ```
    robotmetrics
    ```
    > Case 2: Change in output.xml, log.html file name's And .xml and .html files are under 'Result' folder
    ```
    robotmetrics --inputpath ./Result/ --output "output1.xml" --log "log1.html"
    ```

    > For more info on command line options use:

    ```
    robotmetrics --help
    ```
    
3. RobotFramework Metrics Report __metric-timestamp.html__ file will be created in current folder | `-inputpath` if specified

4. Email will be sent to mentioned recepient with __metric-timestamp.html__ file

---

#### Customize Report

Specify Logo in Robotframework metrics: 

 - __Custom Logo__ : Customize your logo by using --logo command line option

     ```
     --logo "https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images"
     ```
---
#### How to Specifiy EMAIL recepients
 - Default robotmetrics uses gmail server. From command line users have to specific FROM, PWD, TO and CC

    ```
    robotmetrics --email true --from "user1@gmail.com" --pwd "***********" --to "user2@gmail.com,user3@yahoo.com"
     --cc "user4@yahoo.com,user5@gmail.com" 
    
    ``` 

---
#### How to Disable EMAIL
 - By default email will be sent to mentioned recipients when robotmetrics command is executed. Using --email false can disable email

    ```
    robotmetrics --email false
    ```

---

#### How to Ignore Library Keywords in Metrics Report
 - Use command line options to ignore library keywords
    ``` 
    --ignore "Collections,Selenium2Library"
    ```
 - In Metric report, keywords with type value 'for' and 'foritem' are ignored
 - Following library keywords are ignored in Metrics Report
    ```
    ignore_library = [
     'BuiltIn',
     'SeleniumLibrary',
     'String',
     'Collections',
     'DateTime',
    ] 
    ``` 
---

#### Generate robotframework-metrics after execution

Execute robotmetrics command after suite or test execution as follows:

 - Create .bat (or) .sh file with following snippet

    ```
    robot test.robot &&
    robotmetrics [:options]
    ```

    > && is used to execute multiple command's in .bat file

  - Modify robotmetrics command as required and execute .bat file
  
  - Robotframework metrics will be created after execution

---

*Performance Improvement (Beta) *

 - Do you feel robotmetrics command taking more time to capture metrics? Robotframework-metrics have ability to process metrics in parallel using gevent (which helps in saving time)
 > - Step 1: Install gevent
 > - Step 2: Execute robotmetrics command

---
